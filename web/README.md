# README

I followed [this tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/backbonejs-tutorial/) and coded along on the last project of the course which is a todo list app.
However, I used Typescript as I love it and therefore started with my [Parcel typescript template](https://github.com/adblanc/parcel-typescript-tailwindcss) in order to code a vanilla typescript web app.

# Getting started

You need Node.js installed and npm or yarn (node package managers).
You can then run :
```sh
# with yarn
yarn

# or with npm
npm install
```

You can launch dev server using

```sh
yarn dev

# or with npm
npm run dev
```

And you can build the website with

```sh
yarn build

# or with npm
npm run build
```

Make sure that the **rails server is running** on localhost:3000, and everything should be working as expected.

You can make some basic crud operation : create new todos, mark them as completed and delete them.
