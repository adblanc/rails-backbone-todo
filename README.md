# rails-backbone-todo

A simple project before doing ft_transcendance project at @42.
ft_transcendance is a fullstack website, we must use Backbone.JS for the frontend and rails w/ postgresql for the backend.
I made this simple app to learn the basic of Ruby on Rails, Backbone.JS and having the two working together.

Backend -> **Ruby on Rails + PostgreSQL.**<br/>
Frontend -> **BackboneJS + Typescript**
